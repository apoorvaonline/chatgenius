## User Status Feature

### Status Types

Users can have the following status states:

1. **Online** (üü¢) - User is actively using the application
2. **Away** (üü°) - User is logged in but inactive
3. **Do Not Disturb** (üî¥) - User doesn't want to be disturbed
4. **Offline** (‚ö´) - User is not logged in

### Status Behavior

#### Automatic Status Changes

1. **Online to Away**

   - Triggers when user is inactive for 5 minutes
   - Inactivity defined as: no mouse movement, keyboard input, or interaction with the app

2. **Away/DND to Offline**

   - Triggers when user closes the browser/app
   - Triggers on session timeout (after 24 hours of inactivity)
   - Triggers on explicit logout

3. **To Online**
   - When user logs in
   - When user returns from Away status by interacting with the app
   - When user manually sets status to Online

#### Manual Status Control

- Users can manually set their status through a dropdown menu
- Manual "Do Not Disturb" status won't automatically change to Away
- Manual status settings persist until:
  - User manually changes it
  - User logs out
  - Session expires

### Status Display

- Status indicator shown as a colored dot next to user's avatar
- Status visible in:
  - User list
  - Chat messages
  - User profile
  - Channel member lists

### Technical Requirements

1. **Frontend**

   - Status indicator component
   - Status selector dropdown
   - Idle time detection
   - WebSocket connection for real-time status updates

2. **Backend**

   - Status storage in user document
   - WebSocket events for status changes
   - Session management
   - API endpoints for status updates

3. **Database**

   - Add lastActive timestamp to track user activity

### Privacy Considerations

- Users can hide their status from specific users or groups
- Status visibility settings in user preferences
- Option to disable automatic status changes

       {
         emoji: String, // Unicode emoji or custom emoji ID
         users: [userId], // Array of user IDs who reacted
         timestamp: Date, // When the reaction was first added
       },
     ];
     ```
   - Custom emoji collection (if supporting custom emojis):
     ```javascript
     customEmoji: {
       id: String,
       name: String,
       url: String,
       createdBy: userId,

# Message Threading Feature Requirements

## Overview

Add support for message threads (similar to Slack) where users can create conversation threads on any message within a channel. This enables focused discussions without cluttering the main channel.

## Functional Requirements

### Message Thread Creation

- Users can start a thread on any message in a channel
- Only one level of threading is allowed (no nested threads)
- The original message acts as the parent message for the thread
- Thread replies are visually connected to the parent message

### Thread Display

- Parent messages with threads should show:
  - An indicator showing number of replies
  - Timestamp of the latest reply
- Threads should be expandable/collapsible
- Thread view should display:
  - Original parent message at the top
  - Chronological list of thread replies
  - Clear visual distinction from main channel messages

### Thread Interactions

- Users can:
  - Reply to threads
  - Edit their own thread replies
  - Delete their own thread replies
  - View all participants in a thread
  - See real-time updates in threads

### Data Model Updates

- Messages need to track:
  - Thread ID (if message is part of a thread)
  - Parent Message ID (if message is a thread reply)
  - Reply count
  - Latest reply timestamp

### Notifications

- Users should be notified when:
  - Someone replies to their message thread
  - Someone mentions them in a thread
  - New replies are added to threads they're participating in

### API Requirements

- New endpoints needed for:
  - Creating thread replies
  - Fetching thread messages
  - Updating thread status
  - Getting thread statistics

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema Updates

- Message model needs new fields:
  - isThreadParent (boolean)
  - parentMessageId (reference)
  - threadReplyCount (number)
  - lastReplyTimestamp (datetime)

### Real-time Updates

- WebSocket events for:
  - New thread creation
  - New thread replies
  - Thread updates/deletions

### Performance Considerations

- Efficient pagination for thread replies
- Optimized queries for thread statistics
- Caching strategy for active threads

## User Experience Guidelines

- Clear visual hierarchy between main channel and thread messages
- Intuitive thread creation process
- Smooth transitions between channel and thread views
- Clear indicators for unread thread replies
- Easy navigation between threads and main channel

## Future Considerations

- Thread search functionality
- Thread bookmarking
- Thread sharing across channels
- Thread analytics and insights
- Thread archiving
